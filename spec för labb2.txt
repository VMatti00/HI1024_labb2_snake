The game will feature a course where the player controls a snake that navigates towards "food." When the snake reaches the food, the player earns points, and the snake grows longer.

Twist:
There will also be a computer-controlled snake with the same goal as the player's snake: to eat food, grow larger, and dominate the snake world.
